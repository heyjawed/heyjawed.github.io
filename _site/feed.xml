In addition to running Vault itself, the Helm chart is the primary method for installing and configuring Vault to integrate with other services such as Consul for High Availability (HA) deployments.</p>

<p>While the Helm chart automatically sets up complex resources and exposes the configuration to meet your requirements, it does not automatically operate Vault. You are still responsible for learning how to <em>initialize, monitor, backup, upgrade</em>, etc. the Vault cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Steps we will use in this guide</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Create Kubernetes Namespace</li>
  <li>Set Up HashiCorp Helm Repo</li>
  <li>Install Consul Storage backend</li>
  <li>Install Vault in HA mode</li>
  <li>Initialize and Unseal Vault</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="create-kubernetes-namespace">Create Kubernetes Namespace</h2>

<p>Create a K8s namespace.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>kubectl create ns vault-consul

namespace/vault-cluster created
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>View your new K8s objects.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>kubectl get all <span class="nt">-n</span> vault-consul
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="set-up-hashicorp-helm-repo">Set Up HashiCorp Helm Repo</h2>

<p>Helm must be installed and configured on your machine. For help installing Helm, please refer to the <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm documentation</a> or the <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-minikube">Vault Installation to Minikube via Helm</a> tutorial.</p>

<p>Check Helm Version</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>helm version

version.BuildInfo<span class="o">{</span>Version:<span class="s2">"v3.4.1"</span>, GitCommit:<span class="s2">"c4e74854886b2efe3321e185578e6db9be0a6e29"</span>, GitTreeState:<span class="s2">"dirty"</span>, GoVersion:<span class="s2">"go1.15.4"</span><span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To access the Vault and Consul Helm chart, add the Hashicorp Helm repository.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com

<span class="s2">"hashicorp"</span> has been added to your repositories
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check that you have access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Consul</code> chart.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>helm search repo hashicorp/consul

NAME            	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	    DESCRIPTION
hashicorp/consul	0.43.0       	1.12.0     	    Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Check that you have access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vault</code> chart.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>helm search repo hashicorp/vault

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="install-consul-storage-backend">Install Consul Storage backend</h2>

<p>The Consul storage backend is used to <strong>persist Vault’s data in Consul’s key-value store</strong>. In addition to providing durable storage, inclusion of this backend will also register Vault as a service in Consul with a default health check.
<strong>High Availability</strong> – the Consul storage backend supports high availability.</p>

<p>Now you’re ready to install Consul! Install Consul on the dedicated namespace.</p>

Vault initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 3 of these keys to unseal it
before it can start servicing requests.

Vault does not store the generated master key. Without at least 3 keys to
reconstruct the master key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!

It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
existing unseal keys shares. See <span class="s2">"vault operator rekey"</span> <span class="k">for </span>more information.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

SEO(Search engine optimization)is the cheapest way to reach your customer or client. After 2000 the Internet is more easy access to common people and most of the netizens to find out information search on google/yahoo/bing like a search engine. So if your site ranks at the top of the SERP for your target keywords then sure you will get more valuable traffic to your site and it will help you a lot to grow your business.</p>

<p>Above Paragraph, you see SERP or Keywords that are common SEO Term so Before starting learning SEO let’s learn the term used by the SEO expert. It will smoothen your learning journey.

<p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> “Algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.” It is its definition. In SEO we basically mean A very sophisticated and complex program used by the search engine to find out data and indexing it, And when a user gives a data query this program also decides the best result to place in the SERP in order. All search engines use multiple algorithms combination on their data collection and result giving process in different stages.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithm Change:</strong> All the search engine service providers always try to give the best results to their users. So they always working on updating, refreshing or making and implementing new algorithms. The search engine service provider never revealed the exact date of rolling out any updates or new algorithms to make an effective date. Normally they give a boundary of time like this week or this month, we are going to rolling out a major update or applying new this algorithm. They give this new algorithm a name and they always call it by the given name. Like, google spider, Google panda, etc. Most of the time After one to two week we can see and understand the update or change impact but sometimes it also happens quicker also.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Algorithm Update: Search Engines regularly making minor changes in their system they normally don’t give an official announcement. But SEO related blogs and journals give the news what the changes made. So Keep update regular visit this industry-related community is important. And when the Major update come You must observe your ranking behavior and if you find you’ve got the penalty then quickly take necessary step undereating the guidelines given by search engine company.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Algorithm Refresh: Search engine operator after a regular interval re-run the existing algorithm to find out the new spammer.</p>
